Data Analysis Projects

Project 1: Aviation Accident Trends
In this project I explored aviation accident trends from 1948 to 2022 using interactive Tableau visualizations. Instead of just presenting a bunch of statistics, my goal was to show meaningful insights about the complexity of aviation safety. My dashboard focuses on four key questions which are changes in accident rates over time, the relationship between frequency and severity, aircraft models most often involved, and the impact of weather. My intent was to design this Tableau story for everyone, which is why I prioritized clarity and accessibility in the visualizations. Each chart was carefully chosen to communicate insights effectively, with special attention to data quality and presentation.
